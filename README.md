Ohmyfood! Openclassrooms project 3 https://ivanarp.github.io/OhMyFood/

# Objectif:

Create a site prototype by integrating the model designed by the UI designer, in HTML and CSS.<br>
Mobile first. The site is responsive.

# Features:

4 restaurants featured, which contain a menu each.<br>
The background-color on the buttons should be slightly lighten on hover.<br>
The heart icon should be filled progressively with two colors on hover.<br>
A back button should be visible from the restaurant page.<br>
A loading spinner should appear before the main page is shown.<br>
The items in the menu should appear smoothly from the bottom.<br>
the visitor can choose his item, a validation box should then appear from the right, with a rotation for the icon.<br>

# Technical constraints:

Mobile-first approach.<br>
Only the mobile model has been provided, desktop and tablet results are free.<br>
Only CSS can be used, no Javascript and no framework.<br>
Using SASS is required.<br>
